# MyPortfolio
This is an area for me to showcase some of my code that I am writing.

Where I have barrowed code, I will do my best to site the source.

This is only the public code that I want to share and is an example to back my resume. 

Thank you for taking a look!

Please note: This is my code other than where sited. You do not have my permission to borrow it or use it. Thank for respecting my hard work.
